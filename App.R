          nature. However, many species of birds are in decline and in danger of extinction 
          due to many threats. In recorded history, 159 species of birds have already gone 
          extinct, and 1,481 species are currently considered vulnerable, endangered, or

          Volunteer birders recorded instances of different species of birds breeding in each county 
          in New York from 2000 to 2005. Each species of animal is assigned a conservation 
          status rank, which is described in detail <a href=\"https://guides.nynhp.org/definitions/\">here</a>. 
          We condensed the 8+ variables into a binary variable of secure or not secure. 
          Essentially, rankings of 4 and 5 classified as secure, while rankings of 1, 2, 
          and 3 classified as not secure. Some species had a range of rankings. For 
          these species, we used the higher numbered, more-secure ranking. We then used 
          this binary variable to calculate the percentage of species that are not secure 
          by county and by taxonomic subgroup. The code and resulting processed datasets

  characteristic of this figure is that the least biodiverse region of New York State appears 
  to be at the furthest southern tip of New York, right where New York City is located (and 
  consequently the most densely populated region). On the contrary, the most biodiverse region 
  of New York appears to be located near the northern border of the state (the most sparsely 
  populated areas). This relationship could possibly be explained by differences in land area, 
  population size, or climate. In the second plot, we explore the relationship between a 
  county's human population density and it's number of bird species. While the relationship 
  doesn't appear to be too strong, it shows a steep drop off in number of species after 
  approximately 8000 people / mi^2. Counties with such population densities have high

        county and the percent that are not secure. However, we also saw that subgroups 
        like wood-warblers tend to be more diverse but have a fairly low level of insecurity, 
        while groups like ducks, geese, and waterfowl are less diverse but have a higher
        level of insecurity. Another unexpected observation is that there appears to exist 
        a trend in species diversity correlating with latitude, with more bird species in 
        northern counties, and fewer in southern counties. However, this could be due to 
        the southern counties generally having smaller land areas and higher human 
        populations. While not explored here, it is also possible that changes in climate can 
        also explain the number of species varying by latitude. We also found a fairly weak, 
        negative correlation between human population density and the number of bird species 
        in a county. Furthermore, these areas of extreme population density also tend to have 
        high urbanization, which likely causes habitat distruction for many species of birds. 
        We hope that our findings can inform wildlife managers of areas of greater concern for 
        bird species and aid them in making a better plan to protect their ecosystems.
